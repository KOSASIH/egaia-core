# Project EGaia - Core Repository

## Overview

Project EGaia is an innovative ecological restoration initiative that leverages biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and community engagement to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. The `egaia-core` repository serves as the foundational framework for the project, providing essential algorithms, data models, and tools for ecological restoration efforts.

## Features

- **Biotechnology Algorithms**: Tools for genetic engineering and microbial solutions to enhance plant resilience.
- **AI Models**: Machine learning algorithms for drone navigation and ecosystem health monitoring.
- **Drone Control Systems**: Code for managing drone operations and data collection.
- **Data Processing**: Functions for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing ecological data.
- **Community Engagement Tools**: Resources for education and citizen science participation.

## Installation

To set up the `egaia-core` project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/egaia-core.git
   2 cd egaia-core
   ```

 2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**:

    ```bash
    1 python -m venv venv
    2 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
